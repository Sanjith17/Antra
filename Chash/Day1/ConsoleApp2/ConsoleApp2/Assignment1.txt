1) What type would you choose for the following “numbers”?

2)
Both of these are a kind of variables where value variables are stored in the Stack while reference type variables are stored in a heap
Value type stores the value while reference type stores the address of the value
Different type of values type variables are: Integer, float, Boolean, Enum
Different types of reference type variables are String, Array, Class, Interface
Changing Value type into Reference is called as boxing
Changing the reference type into Value type is called as boxing

3)
THe term managed and unmanaged resources denotes two kinds of resources
The Managed resources are managed automatically by the .NET runtime and Common Language Runtime (like String). These resources area allocated and deallocated by the Garbage Colectors
The Unmanaged resources are not managed by the >NET runtime or the CLR. THe Garbage Colelctor will not manage the resources.

4)
The purpose of the Garbage Collector (GC) in .NET is to automatically manage memory by freeing up unused or unreferenced objects from the managed heap, ensuring efficient memory
utilization and preventing memory leaks. It eliminates the need for developers to manually release memory, reducing programming errors like dangling pointers and memory leaks.
This removes the resource that is no longer in use. There are three categories 0,1,2 Generations. THe GC moves the objects starting from Generation 0 to 1 to 2 based on their last usage.
